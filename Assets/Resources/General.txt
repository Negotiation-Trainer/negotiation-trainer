Welcome to Connor Paradise{nm}Once upon a time, three tribes, lived together on the wonderful island of Connor Paradise. The island is located in the Mediterranean Sea and its inhabitants are called the Connors.{nm}Tribe A, the Azari, populate the eastern part of the island, tribe B, the Beluga, inhabit the north, and Tribe C, the Cinatu, live in the south.{nm}Life is very good and peaceful on the island. There is an abundance of food due to the ideal agricultural climate. The three Connor tribes live rather independently of each other.{nm}Because of this, there has been only very limited interaction between the three tribes over the past decades.{nm}The members of all tribes love their island and cannot imagine leaving it under any circumstances.{nm}However, last week a very powerful storm, the worst in history, ravaged the island and severely damaged the infrastructure of every tribe.{nm}With so many houses destroyed and much of their crops lost, all are distraught and worried about their future.{nm}They fear the next storm and urgently demand significant improvements to the islandâ€™s infrastructure, especially relating to disaster warning and response.{nm}The demands of all inhabitants have been collected by the leaders of all three tribes and are summarized into the following eight crucial construction projects.
