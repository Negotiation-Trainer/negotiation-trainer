Welcome to Connor's Paradise. An island located somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, where the inhabitants, called "Connors", lived together in three tribes.{nm}The first Tribe, called the “Azari”, populate the central high part of the island...{nm}...the second tribe, called the “Beluga”, inhabit the forest...{nm}...and the last tribe, called the “Cinatu”, live near the coast.{nm}There is plenty of food, life is good, and all tribes are at peace. Even so the three tribes live independently of each other.{nm}Because of this, there has been very limited need for interaction between the tribes in the past.{nm}The members of all tribes love their island and cannot imagine leaving it under any circumstances.{nm}However, a very powerful storm has just ravaged the island and severely damaged the infrastructure of every tribe.{nm}With so many houses destroyed and much of their crops lost, all three tribes are worried about their future.{nm}They fear the next storm, so they urgently demand significant improvements to the island’s infrastructure.{nm}You are the leader of the Azari tribe. The demands of all inhabitants have been collected by the tribe leaders and are summarized into the following 8 construction projects.{nm}A observation point to identify storms and tsunamis in time{nm}Wave breaker to protect the coast of Connor Paradise{nm}A astronomy Centre to improve weather forecasts{nm}A temple to appease and calm the god Connor{nm}A storm shelter to create a refuge from any future storms{nm}You can repair and improve homes to fix storm damage{nm}A warehouse to store food{nm}You can improve crop yield to increase agricultural productivity{nm}The leaders of each tribe have counted their remaining resources after the storm. It appears not enough resources exist to construct any of these projects independently.{nm}The construction of each project requires ten units of different resources. The resources are only useful for one project.{nm}Therefore, they know that they need to find a way to combine their resources with the other tribes.{nm}Now you, the leader of tribe Azari need to try and maximize your tribe's benefits from these projects. By trading with the other tribes, you can try building some of the projects.{nm}Each project can only be built once. (If for example tribe Beluga builds the observation point, then tribe Cinatu and you tribe Azari cannot build the observation point anymore.){nm}Since there is a storm coming you need to act decisively, for this is likely going to be the heaviest storm the whole of the island has ever witnessed.{nm}If a tribe builds a project, it means they are responsible for this project. Being responsible means that the project is built specifically for your tribe's needs.{nm}This means that if your tribe builds something you gain maximum points, +10 points.{nm}Sometimes a different tribe also has benefits from a project completed by a different tribe.{nm}This means that if your tribe doesn't build something but still benefits, you gain some points, +5 points.{nm}It can also happen that you gain nothing and lose nothing from a project built by a different tribe, so you gain 0 points.{nm}Unfortunately sometimes you gain a disadvantage from a project built by a different tribe, so you lose -5 points.{nm}The last possibility is that no tribe reaches an agreement, which would cause a project to not be built at all. This causes all tribes to suffer, so you (and all others) lose -3 points.
